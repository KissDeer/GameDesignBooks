CHRISTOPHER W. TOTTEN

Written by a game developer and professor trained in architecture, An Architectural Approach to Level Design is one of the first books to integrate architectural and spatial design theory with the field of level design. It explores the principles of level design through the context and history of architecture.

The book presents architectural techniques and theories for you to use in your own work. The author connects architecture and level design in different ways that address the practical elements of how designers construct space and the experiential elements of how and why humans interact with this space. Throughout the text, you will learn skills for spatial layout, evoking emotion through gamespaces, and creating better levels through architectural theory.

# Features

- Presents case studies that offer insight on modern level design practices, methods, and tools- Explores how historical structures can teach us about good level design- Shows how to use space to guide or elicit emotion from players- Discusses spatial design for real-world, persuasive games- Includes chapter exercises that encourage you to create spaces that tell stories, facilitate action, or promote socialization

Bringing together topics in game design and architecture, this book helps you create better spaces for your games. Software independent, the book discusses tools and techniques that you can use in crafting your interactive worlds.

# Introduction

G Ame designer and theorist Ian Bogost has been quoted as outside the field underestimate the amount of work, expertise, and manpower required to make video games, many inside the industry are humbled by game design's staggering complexity. The International Game Developers Association (IGDA) 2008 curriculum framework for game design education is a testament to this complexity. Over twenty- seven pages of its forty- one- page length are devoted to a list of suggested topics to cover in an academic program on game design.2 In The Art of Game Design: A Book of Lenses,3 designer Jesse Schell highlights nineteen fields from which a successful game designer must draw knowledge. Both documents cite topics including business and economics, programming, art, psychology, and theater performance theory. Clearly, the entirety of modern game design is a daunting beast.

Perhaps this is why an important part of the game design process, level design, is so often overlooked as a topic of serious study. Andrew Rollings and Ernest Adams highlight level design's difficulty in their book Andrew Rollings and Ernest Adams on Game Design by arguing that there is no one standard way to design levels.4 Jay Wilbur and John Romero have great respect for the level designer's work, saying "Level Design is where the rubber hits the road"5 and "The level designer is largely responsible for the implementation of the game play in a title."6

Level design is not only an important part of game development, it is also one of the most exhilarating. Many aspiring game designers get their start by creating their own custom levels, called mods, in toolsets for existing games. This act of creating the environment for a game and then playing inside your creation is one of the most empowering parts of video games, as both a hobby and a profession. Some games, such as The Sims7

and Little Big Planet, $^{8}$  even tout their level creation tools on their packaging to entice potential buyers.

The importance of level design in a game project is exactly why it deserves careful consideration as a subject of both academic and professional study. This book is such a study.

# WHAT IS THIS BOOK ABOUT?

This is a book about level design. It is also about how to look at designed space, which game levels, environments, and worlds most certainly are. Real- world architecture, urban environments, and gardens are also designed spaces. At some point, a designer (it doesn't matter which kind; design is mostly universal) sat down to solve a problem that could only be solved by designing an interactive space. This problem could be how to best capture sunlight coming through a window, embody a religious idea, accentuate an important clue to solving a puzzle, or provide the best position for fragging competitors in an online game. Sometimes these spaces are loved by the people who use them, whether it is a home to raise a family, a plaza to enjoy a latte and some people watching, or a city in which to shoot gangsters and jump cars off of piers.

Comparing level design and architecture can be very simple. It can also allow us to reveal things about both we have not seen before. This book reflects on both based on how they solve problems and create meaningful experiences for those using them. From these reflections, this book provides an architectural approach to level design that emphasizes spatial design for maximum user engagement.

# WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM ARCHITECTURE?

In recent years, the topic of game and level design investigating the field of architecture has appeared in many industry discussions, articles, and conference talks. When people think of integrating architectural thought with game design, they often turn to environmental art styles or references to famous buildings. While these things help create interesting level experiences, they are also the tip of the iceberg in terms of game design's current relationship with architectural design. Rather than simply turning to architecture as a reference for surface level visual elements, we can study how architects conduct space and occupant movement. We can also look to architecture and the many fields it references for inspiration, to understand spatial planning, organization, and how to manage relationships between a space and its occupants.

Many seminal books on game design and many seminal game designers do not base their methodologies for creating experiences in game design alone. To do so is very difficult and risks limiting the body of knowledge we can learn from. While games have arguably existed as long as modern man, video games have only existed for about forty years. While the current video game design texts have done well building a critical discourse in that amount of time, there is still much work to be done.

The books and designers that do, however, pull from other fields often do so to fill in blanks that game design itself cannot fill. How do you create a meaningful succession of rewards to entice players through your game and teach them how to play? Look no further than B.F. Skinner's theory of operant behavior. Need a narrative structure for your hero's epic quest? Try Joseph Campbell's monomyth of the hero's journey. What about a way to make little computer people happy in their little computer environment? Try Christopher Alexander's A Pattern Language.

This book will do the same for level design, taking architectural principles and using them as inspiration for video game levels and environments. Like the above examples, level design does not need to stand on its own, but can pull from thousands of years of human knowledge that came before it was a professional field. As designed space, game levels have much to learn from their precursors in real- life architecture, including the development of sight lines, lighting conditions, shade and shadow, exploration, orientation, spatial rhythms, and even how to get epic spaces to be even more epic—among other things.

# BUILDING A BRIDGE BETWEEN GAMES AND ARCHITECTURE

All of this discussion of level design and architecture is well and good, but it is ultimately meaningless unless the spaces that result fit into the context of a game. A game, as defined by Katie Salen and Eric Zimmerman, is "a system in which players engage in an artificial conflict, defined by rules, that results in a quantifiable outcome."

To design a game, therefore, is to create the system, the rules by which it runs and by which a player interacts with it, the artificial conflict it is meant to embody, and the criteria by which an outcome is reached in the system. This closely reflects Salen and Zimmerman's definition of design: "the process by which a designer creates a context to be encountered by a participant, from which meaning emerges."

This definition can mean the design of either games or architecture. In architecture, the architect is the designer, the building or urban space is the context, the participant is anyone who occupies our space, and the experiences that the occupant has while in the space are the meaning that emerges from it. However, establishing a parallel is not enough; a true link must be established between the design of games and the design of architecture.

Consider Rudolf Kremers's definition of level design: "This is a basic purpose of level design, to interpret the game rules, and to translate them into a construct (a level) that best facilitates play. Another way of expressing this is by stating that 'level design is applied game design."14

Kremers's definition is a good one that addresses a level's function as a facilitator of a game's rules, as expressed by Wilbur and Romero, and as a construct created by a designer. Where Kremers's definition falters, however, is in the expression of the level as a medium for creating gameplay and for using spatial design principles to facilitate meaningful user experiences. These experiences can be created through cognitive interactions with the player or through emotional means—all executed through spatial methods that will be discussed in later chapters. A better definition for the purposes of this book would be: "level design is the thoughtful execution of gameplay into gamespace for players to dwell in."

The best level designers do not only take the contents of a game's ruleset and embody them in an interactive space. They also thoughtfully employ spatial articulations that enhance a player's journey through that space. These articulations give previews of what's to come, allow players to orient themselves in the environment, provide narrative clues without the need for overt storytelling methods such as cutscenes, and entice further exploration.

Such spaces are gamespaces—spaces that both embody gameplay and facilitate the player's journey through it, allowing him or her to better experience the game's mechanics. These spaces do so in such a way that players spend more time having fun and less time figuring out how to use the space. As a field that has perfected these kinds of spatial experiences over thousands of years, architecture is the perfect precedent to teach us how to create better gamespaces.

# WHAT THIS BOOK WILL TEACH YOU

This book explores architectural techniques and theories for level designers to use in their own work. The utilized approach connects architecture and level design in different ways that address the practical elements of how designers construct space and the experiential elements of how and

why humans interact with this space. Throughout the book, you will learn the skills listed below.

# Spatial Layout

Learning how to create a spatial sequence is paramount to the study of architectural design. Over centuries of work, the field of architecture has developed a methodology for going from design idea to constructed building. These methods include sketching and modeling crude forms to generate a building idea. They also include more sophisticated renderings of buildings through plan, section, elevation, perspective, and even modern 3D visualization techniques. While this book avoids exploring the nuances of drafting, these techniques will be used to illustrate how to get both macro and micro views of your gamespaces for the sake of event layout and pacing.

Beyond the types of media used to plan buildings, the book also explores how architects deal with materials not just from a structural standpoint, but also from an aesthetic one. While level designers deal with materials primarily on a visual level, the practical concerns of material use can be very useful for level designers. For example, many newer level designers wonder how to make the box- shaped spaces inherent to many level editors seem less boxy. They also wonder how to make their realistically textured surfaces feel more like real- world materials they are conveying in the eyes of players. Understanding how architects use these materials will help create better gamespaces.

# Evoking Emotion through Gamespaces

If using spatial layout techniques is how we create contexts for users to inhabit, then the emotions these contexts create are what give these contexts life. Many buildings in the architectural canon are there because they evoke some greater idea or emotion from occupants. The same can be said of great game levels. Using the arrangements of space as a jumping off point, this book will explore how these arrangements respond to emotional factors of game players.

One way in which game designers and architects are inherently different is in the functions of their spaces. While architects typically design for pure function or for the embodiment of positive emotions, game designers are free to utilize negative emotions such as anger, aggression, or fear. Architects have developed a set of rules not only for what to do in design, but also what not to do. Game designers can look to both sets of rules for

inspiration, arranging the "what to do" spaces among the "what not to do" spaces to create an emotionally exhilarating sequence of gameplay.

Creating Better Levels through Architectural Theory

Rollings and Adams are correct in saying that there is no one way to design levels. For example, a common level design technique such as white- blocking, which will be explored in Chapter 2, can mean different things to different designers. On the other hand, there are common truths to spatial arrangement that transcend concerns about software techniques. By studying spatial arrangement techniques utilized in great architecture and the kinds of experiences these create, level designers will be able to create similar experiences in their own work regardless of the tools they are using.

The effect that level design has on games is profound. As Kremers points out, "Bad level design can ruin a good game."15 In current level design practice, playtesting—evaluating a level by having people play it many times to test for experiential and technical functionality—is the standard way of ensuring that levels are good. Utilizing architectural principles of spatial design in addition to playtesting can do two things to make this process easier. The first is allowing designers to utilize historically successful spatial sequences at the outset of design rather than having them only reach success through experimentation or by copying previous games. Second, having a knowledge of architectural design can give level designers a broader vocabulary with which to create gamespaces. As is common in many branches of design, level designers may be aware of many successful spatial layouts through their experiences in the field or through playing games. However, gaining a vocabulary for these layouts transforms them from vaguely understood secrets to concrete tools that can be used over and over again to great effect.

# WHAT THIS BOOK WILL NOT TEACH YOU

While this book attempts to offer a broad exploration of design concepts that can enrich level design, there is also a lot of information that is outside of its scope. Some of these topics are addressed here to quell any confusion over the material in this book.

# Environment Art

Many game designers confuse level design with the field of environment art. While both contribute to one final finished game level, we will treat

these as two distinct disciplines for the purposes of this book. Level design is concerned with the sequence of spaces in a game level and how they create a better gameplay experience for users. Environment art, on the other hand, is the creation of art assets (3D models, 2D sprites, tiles, or textures) that create the look of a game environment. Neither is more or less important than the other, as good environment art will enliven the sequence of spaces that a level designer creates and often give it a context within the game's narrative. Likewise, a good level can utilize environment art assets as part of its system of visual communication—communicating to the player through the repetition of specific assets that come to mean things within the context of a game.

While this book explores how to best use environment art to communicate to players, it does not cover how to create 3D models or 2D textures, sprites, or tiles in art asset creation programs such as 3D Studio Max, Maya, Blender, or Photoshop. There are, however, many other great books on these topics, which you should explore if you are interested in creating environment art in these programs.

# CAD Software

This book will also not teach you how to utilize computer- aided design (CAD) or building information modeling (BIM) software. As with art asset creation software, teaching these software packages is outside the scope of the book.

As for the use of this software to level designers, CAD is discussed in Chapter 2, "Tools and Techniques for Level Design," as a potential tool for level design, though for different reasons than how architects use it. BIM, on the other hand, is of little use to level designers, as it is much more tightly connected to the construction management functions of real- world architecture. BIM programs such as Revit or ArchiCAD allow designers to create drawings of buildings using premade elements—doors, windows, structural elements, etc.—and store construction information in each specific element that can be used for ordering materials and directing contractors.

# Game Engines

In most applications, level design occurs within programs known as game engines, that are used to create video games. Modern game engines provide a framework for rendering assets on screen, responding to player input, facilitating artificial intelligence (AI) interactions, simulating real- world

physics, among other things. In the industry, many different game engines exist, with some studios building their own for internal use. While there are popular ones, there is no universally agreed- upon industry standard as with other types of software.

This book describes a selection of engines that are popular at the time of its writing, but it avoids providing in- depth software tutorials for using these engines. This is done for two reasons: one is the aforementioned lack of an industry standard. If this book contained tutorials in the Unity engine, for example, it would be a Unity engine book, rather than one approachable for users of Source or the Unreal Development Kit. Engines come and go as technology advances, so it is hoped that readers can get more evergreen knowledge from this book even when today's engines are historic footnotes. As with environment art, a wide selection of books that teach the use of these game engines is available that interested readers can explore.

# WHO SHOULD READ THIS BOOK

This book looks at level design through the lens of architectural and spatial experience theory. While matters relevant to game art are discussed, it is not a book on environmental modeling or how to create 3D game assets. If you have not yet bought this book and are perhaps reading it in a bookstore, then you may want to see if you fit into one of the following groups:

The level designer who wants to understand architecture better and bring elements of it into his or her work. Many discussions of game levels and architecture focus on environment art creation, with statements of how "cool" certain architectural styles or layouts would look in the art for a game. This book brings level designers into the fray by discussing spatial concepts that have bearing on the layout and arrangement of gamespaces relevant to their gameplay goals. It also features interviews with industry veterans who have spent time building game levels and worlds, or who have contributed to the field in other ways.

The environment artist seeking to better communicate with players through his or her work. The environment artist is not forgotten in this text. Visual communication with players involves the graphics, colors, forms, and textures that constitute a game's environmental art assets. Throughout the book, methodologies for utilizing a game's artistic presentation together with its spatial gameplay design are proposed for creating memorable player experiences.

Teachers and students studying level design. This book approaches level design from a point of view that synthesizes several bodies of knowledge into one source and employs them through case studies. With the advent of the game design degree, a danger facing the industry is the loss of the eclectic experiences of designers who come from other backgrounds to join the gaming industry. By viewing an important element of game creation, level design, through topics relevant to architecture, this book gives teachers and students in game design programs a broad landscape to pull from. Students especially can look to designer interviews to gain insight into the process from industry veterans.

Architects. While this book mainly focuses on the practice of level design as educated by architectural principles, it is also written to enliven architectural design through the implementation of game design methodologies. This book recommends an iterative workflow focused around playtesting and audience interaction in interactive spatial simulations. Many architects today find themselves frustrated by the confines of 2D space and the guesswork that comes with trying to create meaningful spatial experiences with plan, elevation, and section drawings. This book discusses space and architecture as an interactive medium dependent on user input, much as it was throughout history.

Overall, if you have an interest in game design, level design, or architecture, this book will provide a focused and practical approach to level design that cannot be found elsewhere. Whether you are a professional level designer, artist, or teacher looking for another perspective on your craft, a game design student looking for input from other industries, or an architect trying to learn what all these interactive technologies can do for your own industry, this book has something for you. As games approach that murky and difficult- to- define status known as art, they should be studied in the light of other fields that create meaningful user experiences or even as brave new examples for the established canon.

# HOW TO USE THIS BOOK

This book is separated into a variety of topics on experiential concepts in architectural and video game level design. These concepts are approached in a general manner rather than focusing on specific game types or genres. For example, there are no chapters with names such as "Sight Lines for First- Person Shooters," but rather ones on spatial design elements that can be applied to many game types. This was done purposefully so that

the techniques are explored in a less prescriptive manner, and so that designers can implement them in any way they choose.

While the subject of each chapter can be understood without reading the chapters that came before, each portion of the book builds on the knowledge from previous sections. As such, it is recommended that readers read chapters in order to avoid confusion when a chapter refers to information given in one preceding it.

# HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

This book practices some software agnosticism by not making tutorials in a certain application a requirement. However, readers may wish to practice the level design methods in one of several popular game engines. Many of the most widely used game engines for both independent and commercial game development offer free versions, often for non- commercial use. Check their websites to find out the exact terms of how they may be licensed. Here are a few links to websites where you can learn about acquiring free game engine software:

# WHAT'S INSIDE THIS BOOK

This book explores an architectural approach to level design through a variety of topics on spatial design. Each topic is accompanied by studies of both game level and real worldbuilding cases. Through these studies, the book proposes spatial design principles for game levels in 2D, 3D, and multiplayer applications. Each chapter is also accompanied by a level design exercise so users can practice what they've learned. The chapters and the topics they cover are as follows.

Chapter 1, "A Brief History of Architecture and Level Design"

This chapter gives a brief overview of the architectural history that is relevant throughout the rest of the book. This includes a listing of styles and techniques from prehistory through Postmodernism. This chapter also discusses several milestones in how the spaces of games evolved from single- screen games with limited movement into the sprawling 3D worlds of current games.

Chapter 2, "Tools and Techniques for Level Design"

This chapter further explores our definition of level design and provides an overview of some useful tools for level designers to use in creating their gamespaces, including popular software packages such as Unity, the Unreal Development Kit, and the Source engine. It also details types of architectural drawings and visualization useful for planning spaces. Lastly, it covers some game design workflows, how they can utilize architectural techniques, and how they can be used to implement spatial designs.

Chapter 3, "Basic Gamespaces"

This chapter teaches lessons on architectural spatial arrangement, starting from basic principles and then applying these principles to several

famous types of gamespaces, such as linear and sandbox spaces. It then analyzes spaces in famous games to discover spatial types that can be used among a variety of games. Lastly, it discusses how game cameras accentuate level spaces in games based on their positioning in relation to the player character.

Chapter 4, "Teaching in Levels through Visual Communication"

Chapter 4 moves beyond overviews of how spaces are used in games and investigates how creating repeatable architectural forms allows designers to communicate with players. Such techniques are demonstrated as methods for changing player behaviors and teaching players game mechanics through subtle in- level tutorials. They are also discussed as methods for helping players retain and develop their knowledge of how to play through a game through level design.

Chapter 5, "Introducing Emotional Level Design through Survival Instincts"

This chapter introduces spatial arrangements and techniques that allow designers to evoke emotions connected with human survival instincts. It shows how arrangements of specifically sized spaces entice players to move along paths. It also shows techniques for using lighting to engage curiosity or fear responses.

Chapter 6, "Enticing Players with Rewarding Spaces"

Chapter 6 utilizes psychological theories popular with game designers to discover how game levels can reward players. It explores the architectural principle of denial to show how spaces and sight lines can be used to make levels that entice players to move through them.

Chapter 7, "Storytelling in Gamespace"

This chapter addresses narrative elements of games and explores the different ways that built spaces can tell or facilitate stories. It discusses how changes in materials and environment art can assist the storytelling process. It also explores how storytelling opportunities can be rewards for passing through difficult gameplay sequences.

Chapter 8, "Possibility Spaces and Worldbuilding"

This chapter discusses how game levels can be built to accommodate different player styles and create robust worlds with many play choices. It discusses

how some gamespaces expand based on the abilities players have and that they acquire during gameplay. It also shows how some architects and game designers provide visual overviews of the spaces they create, and how ancient practices of Japanese garden design can inform the designs of game worlds.

Chapter 9, "Influencing Social Interaction with Level Design"

Chapter 9 explores how urban designers arrange buildings of different use types to facilitate social interaction and unforeseen in- game events. These studies can influence quest structure in single- player games, or even how players interact in massively multiplayer online (MMO) games.

Chapter 10, "Enhancing Level Design with Music and Sounds"

Chapter 10 addresses an often- overlooked part of spatial design in games: sound design. It explores how architects have used acoustic design to create different spatial experiences and how rhythms in space and sound can drive gameplay. It also explores how sound can enhance many of the spatial types found elsewhere in the book.

Chapter 11, "Real- World Adaptive Level Design"

In this final chapter, level design is taken out of video games and brought in to the real world through modern trends in outdoor game design. This chapter discusses how to utilize level design principles to design games for existing urban and outdoor spaces. Through these types of games, designers can allow people to discover new things about their own real- world environments.
